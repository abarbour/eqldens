Version: 0.1.9999
Date: 2015-11-12
Author: Andrew J Barbour (R-code), Duncan Carr Agnew (mapping method)
Maintainer: Andrew J Barbour <andy.barbour@gmail.com>
Description: Agnew (2015) proposed a new way to visualize large
    earthquake catalogs by mapping the observed distribution of magnitudes
    onto a Gutenberg-Richter distribution, thereby eliminating as many
    instances of overlapping data as possible.
